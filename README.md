# Discord-Server-Bumping-Macro

I created this repo because the admind for a server I'm a part of jokingly asked me to creat a repo for Macro I made with Auto Hot Keys.

The Macro is made to past 5 commands for their Discord bot to read so my lazy &%$#@! doesn't have to copy past 5 commands.

After the 5 commands are sent there's a 3 second delay and a messege for a Discord Bee link because their bot always fails to send that link. The delay is ther so it doesn't overlap their bot when it sends another link as the result of the last command, you can reduce it if you want but my internet is slow as hell so... yeah... 3 seconds it is.

This repository will include a .ahk file for those who have Auto Hot Keys installed because using that needs Auto Hot Key and a .exe for those who don't want to have Auto Hot Keys on their system and sorry GNU/Linux guys but I have no idea how to use shell.

This software or script, depending on what you download will stay active in the back ground so you have to close it manually.

# The Macros

ctrl + Alt + p = pastes the 5 commands and after 3 seconds the Discord Bee link.

(The hot key is chosen like that because P is usually assosiated with pasting)

ctrl + Alt + o = Pastes the command for the bot to clear the board and thank you for bumping the server

(The hot key is chosen because it's close to the previous one, you have a problem? Change it, or sue me... but I prefare if you change it rather than sueing)

# How to make it run at start up?

Well dear reader, I'm gonna tell you how so you don't have to know or search this.

In order for the script or software to start on start up you have to put a shortcut or .lnk to it ( I heard it's  a good practice to not have the real deal there) in your start up folder.

Where's the start up folder? MAN! What are you doing on windows?

It's in:

C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

What? You want me to tell you how to creat a shortcut too?

Fine! Right Click on the file you downloaded from here and literally select the creat shortcut option than cut (ctrl + X) it and paste (ctrl + V) it in the startup folder

# .ahk Requirements
Functioning Windows 7 and up, not sure but I think that's what Auto Hot Key Needs (Look you should know this if you are using Auto Hot keys anyway)

Auto Hot Keys

# .exe Requirements
Functioning Windows
